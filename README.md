## General Description
**Tender Wema** is a web application that works to provide its users with an efficient and fast tendering process. Tendering Processes in most companies are usually done physically and often take a lot of time; months sometimes years, to be completed. __Tender Wema__ aims to cut down on the amount of time it takes to make a tender proposal, review the proposal and award it to a supplier. __Tender Wema__ makes use of a RESTful API that allows its users to publish tenders, make proposals as well as award tenders after review.
